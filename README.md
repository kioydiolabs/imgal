# Usage

### To create a photo library with imgal, follow the instructions below.

Before running the script, you need to install the python library "Pillow".
```shell
pip3 install Pillow
```

1) Create a folder, and inside, download and extract the [imgal-builder.zip](https://github.com/kioydiolabs/imgal/releases/latest) file. **Do not delete the templates folder.**
2) Place all the pictures you want to include in the photo library in a folder, **with no other files**.
3) Open your terminal, and run the imgal-builder.py file.
4) Follow the instructions. In the last step, enter the full path of the directory where the images are stored.

Your library has now been created! You should find all the files in the directory where the images were stored.
