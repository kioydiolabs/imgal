# Usage

### To create a photo library with imgal, follow the instructions below.

1) Create a folder, and inside, download and extract the imgal-builder.zip file. **Do not delete the templates folder.**
2) Place all the pictures you want to include in the photo library in a folder, **WITH NO OTHER FILES**.
3) Open your terminal, and run the imgal-builder.py or imgal-builder.exe file.
4) Follow the instructions. In the last step, enter the full path of the directory where the images are stored.

Your library has now been created! You should find all the files in the directory where the images were stored.
