# Creating an Image gallery

### Prerequisites

To use Imgal you need Python and the Pillow package installed. Learn how to do that [here](Prerequisites.md).

### Organizing your files before creating the gallery

Extract the Imgal zip file.

In a folder, place the `imagal.py` file and the `templates` folder found in the zip file.

In the same folder, create another folder, and place your images in it.

### Creating the image gallery

In your Terminal or Powershell, go to the directory where the `imgal.py` file is.

Then run the command :
```Shell
python imgal.py
```

Now follow the instructions of the program. When it's done, you will find the website structure in the
folder where the images were stored. You can then delete the `templates` folder and `imgal.py`.

**You can now upload the gallery to your web server.**
